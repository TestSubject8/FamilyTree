# Lengaburu
Lengaburus family tree is too complicated for their ministers and court to keep track of. They have to navigate their complicated social structure and avoid embarrassing themselves every single day!
One smart jester used a rock with lightning inside and a slithery friend to help them figure out who is who!

The court puts the name of the person and the relation they want to find on a scroll, and feeds it to the mighty python Lengaburu, named after their kingdom, who digests the history of their family line, and tells them the information they seek. 
Lengaburu also keeps a record of every birth in the family.
